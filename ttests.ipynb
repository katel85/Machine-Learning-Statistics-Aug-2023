    "# The strange origins of the Student’s t-test\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "William Sealy Gosset (13 June 1876 – 16 October 1937) was an English statistician, chemist and brewer who served as Head Brewer of Guinness and Head Experimental Brewer of Guinness and was a pioneer of modern statistics.\n",
    "\n",
    "Gosset’s academic background may seem at odds with his employment as a brewer, but Guinness realized around this time that in order to maintain its dominant market share as the biggest brewer in Ireland, it would have to introduce brewing on a carefully controlled industrial scale. Such a venture would require rigorous quality control; hence the requirement for university trained chemists and statisticians. As any amateur brewer will attest, the brewing of beer has an element of the unknown, with success being not only dependent on the correct procedure, but also an element of luck! It was this reliance on luck for a successful product that Guinness sought to eliminate by scientific procedure. Beer, of course, is a combination of natural products; malted barley, hops and yeast, all mixed with water. These natural products share an inherent variability common to all agricultural products, whose quality is dependent not only upon crop variety, but also on climate, soil conditions, etc. Gosset’s task as Apprentice Brewer was not only to assess the quality of these products, but also to do so in a cost effective manner. This necessitated using experiments with small sample numbers to draw conclusions that could be applied to the large scale brewing process. However, Gosset discovered that in using small samples the distribution of the means deviated from the normal distribution. He therefore could not use conventional statistical methods based upon a normal distribution to draw his conclusions.\n",

    "\n",
    "In today's data-driven world, businesses can't rely on intuition alone to make critical decisions. Instead, they need to use statistical techniques like hypothesis testing to back up their actions with solid data. One popular test for this purpose is the t-test, which allows you to compare the means of two groups and determine whether they're statistically different.\n"

    "What is a Paired T Test?\n",
    "Use a paired t-test when each subject has a pair of measurements, such as a before and after score. A paired t-test determines whether the mean change for these pairs is significantly different from zero. This test is an inferential statistics procedure because it uses samples to draw conclusions about populations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Paired t tests are also known as a paired sample t-test or a dependent samples t test. These names reflect the fact that the two samples are paired or dependent because they contain the same subjects. Conversely, an independent samples t test contains different subjects in the two samples.\n",
    "\n",
    "Perhaps you have a sample of wood boards, and you paint half of each board with one paint and the other half with the other paint. Then, you measure the paint durability for both types of paint on all the boards. Each board has two paint durability scores, and you want to determine whether the two paints have different durability.(1)"
